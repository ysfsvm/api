# ysf's API
A simple API project for me. It provides essential functionalities through organized endpoints and includes tracking modules for various services.

## API Endpoints:
Path: `/api/...`
Example: example.com/api/...

Path: `/track/[provider]/[barcode]`
Example: example.com/track/ptt/KPxxxxxxxx
For now this project has 3 providers these are `hepsijet`, `ptt`, and `yurti√ßi`

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage
```bash
node server.js
```
